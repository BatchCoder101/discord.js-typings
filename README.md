# Typings for [discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js)

These typings should work as the library updates with new things.
Of course these ones try to mimick the documentation and source code as much as possible.

## FAQ:

1. Was this machine generated? No
2. Why not? Well if you ever looked the documentation yourself you would see many errors when it comes to using them. (e.g text linking to a non-existent type). So better off if you figure them out yourself and not rely on machines doing them for you all the time.
